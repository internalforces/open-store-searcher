# Current Session — open-store-searcher

_Last updated: 2026-09-04_

## Current TASK-008 Session

### macOS continuation delivery

The user confirmed that the previous Ubuntu Docker environment was on their Mac and explicitly
requested committing, pushing, and opening a PR for continuation there. Deliver the current
verified implementation and investigation on `codex/task-008-planning`, with `main` as the PR
base. Keep the PR in draft while TASK-008 production evidence and PRD gates remain open.

Implementation commit `d3e1825` was pushed to origin. Draft
[PR #12](https://github.com/internalforces/open-store-searcher/pull/12) is the continuation PR.

On the Mac, fetch this branch and preserve any existing local edits before switching. Read the
normal context-loading sequence, then inspect the existing Docker context, containers, images,
and mounts to identify the Ubuntu 24.04 environment. Container identity and current health are
still unverified. The removed `--docker-container` probe option is not supported: use the normal
probe within a compatible Linux environment with correct repository/staging visibility and pass
the existing environment gate before provider requests. Check the original PRD path recorded in
`memory/project.md`, then resolve the observation-path and production-evidence gates documented
in `reports/research-2026-09-04-task-008-completion-gates.md`. TASK-009 remains inactive.

### Remaining-work follow-up

The user requested completion of the remaining gates. Read-only investigation is recorded in
`reports/research-2026-09-04-task-008-completion-gates.md`. Local document directories and Git
history did not provide the original PRD. The existing collector adapter returned `{ "ok": false }`;
WSL is not installed, and the configured Ubuntu VM is powered off and not the verified 24.04
baseline. GitHub returned no workflow runs or artifacts. Current official metadata still does
not prove an archive-bound shared source cut. No production facts or approvals were invented.

The schema-only probe deletes its archive and cannot produce calibration metrics. A reviewed
row-observation path is required to resolve the TASK-008/TASK-009 dependency explicitly. The user
was asked for the original PRD location and previous Ubuntu access. In the follow-up, the user
recalled local Docker. History confirms a Docker probe option added on August 28 and removed
on August 30 because its host/container staging paths were not supported. The current Windows
host has no discovered Docker CLI, Desktop installation/configuration, process, service, or
configured Docker environment variables. Historical records identify macOS development and
successful Ubuntu 24.04 checks but no actual container name. The user subsequently confirmed
that the Docker host was their Mac; no environment was started or installed on Windows.
TASK-008 remains active and incomplete. No source code, runtime, dependency,
workflow, production data, or previously verified result changed in this follow-up.

### Verified implementation handoff

- Date: 2026-09-04; roles: Implementer / Tester, with independent helper and Reviewer agents.
- Request: Execute TASK-008; user explicitly approved ADR-014 after the design was presented.
- Branch: `codex/task-008-planning`; preserved pre-existing planning notes and design edits.
- Implemented: staged refresh validator, metrics and runtime guards, shared Seoul calendar
  freshness helper, and separate UTF-8 JSON syntax/byte-limit helper. All are offline and do not
  publish, mutate a baseline, infer unsupported source-cut dates, or change status mappings.
- Test-first evidence: missing-module red runs; review regressions reproduced sparse-array and
  corrupted-collision acceptance plus malformed-policy precedence before fixes.
- Verification: pinned Node.js 24.19.0/npm 11.17.0 `npm run verify:full` exited 0: 362 Vitest
  tests passed, two existing Windows Info-ZIP skips, four browser tests, two zero-violation
  accessibility scans. 144 tests are new. Mapper and shared freshness coverage remain 100%.
- Independent Reviewer: Approved bounded implementation, independently reran all 144 TASK-008
  tests. Three review findings resolved. No new known code issue remains.
- Evidence: `reports/test-2026-09-04-task-008.md`,
  `reports/review-2026-09-04-task-008.md`, accepted validation design, and .testagent records.
- TASK-008 is still the only active task. Remaining gates: production source-cut evidence across
  all 195 categories, measured/approved policy and bootstrap baseline, and original PRD access
  or explicit authoritative-baseline direction. The previous request for the PRD path is unanswered.
- No completed-ledger entry was added because TASK-008 is not complete. TASK-009 is not activated;
  it owns production parser integration, exact public artifact-byte binding and atomic recovery.
- No dependencies, workflows, public identifiers, production data, deployment, or handbook
  changes were made. Commit/push/PR delivery was subsequently authorized above. M1 closure is
  not reached.
- Final `git diff --check` and scoped new-file whitespace checks passed; status was inspected.

## Previous TASK-007 Session Information

- Date: 2026-09-04
- Roles: Implementer / Tester, with an independent Reviewer
- Goal: Implement accepted ADR-013 using tests first, reach 100% mapper file coverage, and pass full verification.
- Branch: `codex/task-007-status-mapping`, created from `codex/task-006-implementation` while preserving pre-existing TASK-006 acceptance and TASK-007 design edits.

## Completed This Session

- [x] Recorded the user's explicit `accept` as ADR-013 approval before implementation.
- [x] Added failing domain and transformer tests before production changes.
- [x] Implemented exact aggregate-pair mapping in a pure domain module, retaining all raw evidence.
- [x] Added processed status to transformation schema V2; identity and normalization stay V1.
- [x] Passed 86 unit tests and 131 pipeline tests; two existing Windows Info-ZIP tests remain skipped.
- [x] Passed pinned Node.js 24.19.0/npm 11.17.0 full verification: lint, format, typecheck, 218 passing Vitest tests, build, four browser smoke tests, and two accessibility scans.
- [x] Confirmed mapper statement, branch, function, and line coverage of 100% and enforced the exact-file threshold.
- [x] Obtained independent Reviewer Approved with no material findings.
- [x] Moved TASK-007 to the completed ledger and updated architecture, traceability, decisions, and issue notes.

## Evidence

- `reports/test-2026-09-04-task-007.md`
- `reports/review-2026-09-04-task-007.md`
- `.testagent/research.md`, `.testagent/plan.md`, `.testagent/status.md`
- `coverage/domain/index.html` (local generated coverage)

## Previous TASK-007 Handoff (Superseded by Current TASK-008 Session)

TASK-008 validation design is next in the backlog; no implementation task is active.
Define conservative freshness and validation policies before implementation and obtain human
approval for any newly gated choice. Status-distribution validation, `dataAsOf`, publication,
public identifier text and share URLs remain outside TASK-007.

## Historical Post-Merge Planning Assessment (Before Activation)

The user reported PR #11 merged and requested identification of the next task. GitHub confirmed
merge commit `72a8eab` on 2026-09-04. Planning notes are on `codex/task-008-planning`, based on
the merged main branch. TASK-008 remains unactivated; no implementation started.

- Next: TASK-008 validation design, M1, High priority, size L; FR-08, FR-13, FR-14.
- Define validation input/output and rejection diagnostics using the accepted collector evidence
  and transformation schema V2. Reuse existing header, identity, and exact-status checks.
- Resolve conservative `dataAsOf` derivation, source-date/timezone semantics, and the boundary
  before/at/after seven days. Retrieval time alone must not become the data as-of date.
- Define total/category count changes, required-value/missing-value rules, duplicate identity
  handling, unknown status diagnostics, JSON validity/byte limits, and first-run baseline behavior.
- Distinguish an unverified record from an invalid refresh; ADR-013 mapping must remain unchanged.
- Do not invent numerical thresholds. Record evidence, proposed policy, and any approval gates
  before implementation. Publication and last-known-good replacement remain TASK-009; Actions
  integration remains TASK-010.
- Resolve the unimplemented upstream CSV row-parser boundary and the TASK-009-owned collision
  and malformed-input policies before expanding TASK-008 scope.
- The source PRD path recorded in memory/project.md is unavailable on this Windows host, and no
  source PRD copy was found among repository PRD-named files. Use current traceability for this
  assessment; locate the authoritative PRD before claiming exact design acceptance against it.
- Next deliverable: an English validation design with a requirements/test matrix, then test-first
  implementation and full verification after gated decisions are resolved.

## Important Context

TASK-006 had already been accepted; remote inspection confirmed PR #9 and PR #10 were merged
into main on 2026-09-02. After TASK-007 verification, the user explicitly requested commit,
push, and PR creation. Delivery uses `codex/task-007-status-mapping` with main as its PR base.
No TASK-007 merge, deployment, dependency/workflow change, production-record operation, or
Korean handbook access is authorized by that delivery request.
The approved V1 mapper deliberately ignores detailed status fields, even when they differ from
aggregate evidence; later refinements require official evidence and new human approval.
M1 remains open and its Korean handbook review gate has not been reached.

## TASK-012 isolated PR delivery — 2026-09-05

The user authorized commit, push and PR creation after TASK-012 approval. Created a dedicated
worktree and branch codex/task-012-candidate-search from origin/main (095683a). Copied only the
reviewed TASK-011 normalization prerequisite and TASK-012 engine/tests/design, with search-owned
harness updates. Unrelated TASK-008 code, decoder dependency, reports and local state remain in
the original checkout, untouched. Historical 557/581 test counts in the imported reports describe
that original integration worktree, not this baseline. The delivery report records isolated checks.
No implementation task is active; TASK-013 is next, TASK-008 stays deferred/incomplete. No deployment,
merge, new dependency, public schema, production data or handbook changes are included.

Isolated delivery verification passed on the actual PR contents: unchanged-lockfile clean install,
399 tests, eight browser tests and two accessibility scans. Search implementation/test bytes match
the independently approved original; see reports/delivery-2026-09-05-task-012.md. The user authorized
pushing this branch and creating the PR against main. No merge or deployment is authorized here.
